# Contributing

## How to contribute?

There are many things you can do to contribute SassDoc:

* Report a bug
* Fix a bug or implement a new feature
* Suggest a new feature
* Improve the documentation

## Asking a question

Please, do not open an issue only to ask a question; it is not the best place for this. First, make sure your question is not already answered in the [FAQ](https://github.com/SassDoc/sassdoc/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions). 

If it's not, please get in touch on Twitter when possible: [@HugoGiraudel](https://twitter.com/hugogiraudel), [@Fweinb](https://twitter.com/fweinb), [@valeriangalliat](https://twitter.com/valeriagalliat), [@pascalduez](https://twitter.com/pascalduez).

## Filling a bug

So you think you've found a bug? Hey, we're all humans after all! Before even opening an issue, you have to know how SassDoc is architectured:

* [Core](https://github.com/sassdoc/sassdoc) (you're here)
* [Default theme](https://github.com/sassdoc/sassdoc-theme-default) (which leads to [Light Theme](https://github.com/sassdoc/sassdoc-theme-light))
* [Filters](https://github.com/sassdoc/sassdoc-filter)
* [Indexer](https://github.com/sassdoc/sassdoc-indexer)
* [Grunt plugin](https://github.com/sassdoc/grunt-sassdoc)
* [Gulp plugin](https://github.com/sassdoc/gulp-sassdoc)

If you believe your issue is related to any of those repositories, please first give GitHub's search a try to make sure someone didn't already submit something similar.

If what you've found seems unique, be sure to open an issue in the appropriate repository with a clear title and a description as complete as possible.

Avoid titles like "it doesn't work", "please help me", and "bug with sassdoc". It doesn't help much understanding the problem at first glance.

Be as descriptive as possible within your description. If you have a stack trace, post it. If you can make a screenshot, even better! Explain the problem and how you get there. Only then we'll be able to investigate.

## Submitting a pull request

Want to contribute? Awesome! If it's a little something, feel free to jump on it and submit a pull request; chances are high it will be quickly merged.

If you are thinking of something a bit more complex, be sure to talk with someone from the team before even starting coding in order to avoid any useless work.

Anyway, thank you very much for contributing.
